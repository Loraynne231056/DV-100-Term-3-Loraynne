# About the Project

### The project is a website for a cruise liner company. The company is called Nautica and it specialises in arctic and baltic cruises. I'm telling you, icebergs are weak compared to our indestructable cruise ships. Geez Bob. Your safety is 100% garanteed.

## **Home Page**
The hero page has a carousel slider, a gallery, an FAQ accordion, and weather cards.

## **Checkout Page**
The checkout page has a table with your orders listed on it. The table contains information such as the name, quantity, duration, trip code, and duration of the trip. There is also a remove button and remove all button. There's a total price and a proceed to payment button that leads to a "Thank you" modal
